Classification of EphA4 Receptor Antagonist Inhibitors (AID 689) Using XGBoost:
The EphA4 receptor tyrosine kinase is known for its crucial role in preventing axon regeneration after spinal cord injuries. Research has demonstrated that in the absence of EphA4, axons can regrow beyond injury sites, restoring lost connections and enabling functional recovery. Additionally, EphA4 inhibits axonal and dendritic growth in various parts of the central nervous system and is involved in maintaining platelet aggregation during blood clot formation and promoting prostate cancer cell proliferation.

Targeting EphA4 with specific inhibitors holds significant therapeutic promise for a range of conditions, including spinal cord injuries, thrombosis, and cancer. This project aims to classify inhibitors of the EphA4 receptor (from the AID 689 dataset) as active or inactive using the XGBoost machine learning algorithm. By creating an effective classification model, we can facilitate the identification of potential therapeutic compounds.

Leveraging XGBoost for the classification of EphA4 receptor antagonists provides a powerful tool for discovering effective inhibitors. This project contributes to the advancement of therapies aimed at enhancing axon regeneration, preventing thrombosis, and inhibiting cancer cell growth. By accurately classifying active inhibitors, we can prioritize candidates for further research and development, accelerating the journey towards new treatments for various medical conditions.
